## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React.js (with Vite)
* **Styling:** CSS
* **API:** OpenWeatherMap API

## ⚙️ Installation & Local Development

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
* A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
* An API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (sign up for a free account)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/KARTHIKAKRISHNA123/Live_Weather_Dashboard.git](https://github.com/KARTHIKAKRISHNA123/Live_Weather_Dashboard.git)
    cd Live_Weather_Dashboard/Live_Weather_Dashboard # Navigate into the correct project folder
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project (same level as `package.json`).
    * Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to this file:
        ```
        VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
        ```
        Replace `YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` with the key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn dev
    ```

    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## 🌍 Deployment

This application is deployed using Netlify. The `VITE_API_KEY` is securely stored as an environment variable in Netlify's build settings.
